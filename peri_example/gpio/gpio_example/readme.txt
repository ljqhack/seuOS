General Purpose Input/Output Example
====================================

Example Description
-------------------
The General Purpose Input/Output example demonstrates how to use the GPIO functions
for multiple GPIO pin functions at once. The example sets port 0 pins 0-3 (0-1 on 824)
to GPIO outputs.  It then demonstrates masked write operations on P0 using
an incrementing counter.  Output can be observed on port 0 pins 0-3 (0-1 on 824).
